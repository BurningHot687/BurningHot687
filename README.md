# Hello!

I am **BurningHot687**, and I am here. I'm just a guy who likes to code.

Instead of putting my whole life story or even just my experience with programming, I just want to ask if you've also just went to the wrong place in your home to do something, and then realized that and had to go to the correct place?

Cheers!
